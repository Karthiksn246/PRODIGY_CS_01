"Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption"
This Python script provides a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

# Features
Encrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm with a specified shift value.
Decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm with the same or opposite shift value.
User-friendly interface allowing users to input messages and shift values interactively.
Option to continue encrypting or decrypting more messages.


# Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/Karthiksn246/PRODIGY_CS_01.git

2. Navigate to the directory:
    cd PRODIGY_CS_01

3. Run the Python script:
    python main.py


Follow the on-screen prompts to choose between encryption or decryption, input your message, and specify the shift value.

After each encryption or decryption, you will be prompted to continue the process. Type 'yes' to continue or any other key to exit.

Requirements
Python 3.x
