"Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption"
This Python script provides a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

# Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/Karthiksn246/PRODIGY_CS_01.git

2. Navigate to the directory:
    cd PRODIGY_CS_01

3. Run the Python script:
    python main.py


Follow the on-screen prompts to choose between encryption or decryption, input your message, and specify the shift value.

After each encryption or decryption, you will be prompted to continue the process. Type 'yes' to continue or any other key to exit.
